## Execise 1.16

I made a simple Django app for this exercise. It is a phonebook app where users can create new contacts and remove them. The app is running in Fly.io. I deployed it by running the command ```flyctl launch``` in the project root and following the instructions.
There was some CSRF-related issues at first. After doing a few changes to the project's code the app started running without any problems.
